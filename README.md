### **Why This Exists**  
OP wanted to play Pong. Instead, they spent 12 hours debugging `gymnasium` wrappers and crying over `axis=0` errors. This repo is the result of that trauma.  

**Current Status:**  
- Training code: ‚úîÔ∏è Works (kinda)  
- Playable demo: ‚ùå *"–°–¥–µ–ª–∞—é –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º"‚Ñ¢*  

---

### **What‚Äôs Inside**  
1. **DQN Implementation**: For when you want to brute-force Pong with a neural net.  
2. **Custom Wrappers**: Because `gymnasium`‚Äôs `terminated` vs `truncated` is a prank by evil devs.  
3. **MPS Support**: Lets your MacBook sound like a jet engine!

### **How to Run (Training)**  
1. **Clone this dumpster fire**:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git && cd repo  
```  

nah paste normal links here

2. **Install dependencies**:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # `gymnasium` included. You‚Äôre welcome.  
```  

3. **Train the model**:  
```bash  
python main.py --mps  # Requires Apple Silicon and a strong will to live  
```

### **Testing (Coming Soon‚Ñ¢)**  
*"Playable version? Later"*  
OP‚Äôs TODO list:  
- [ ] Add `play.py`  
- [ ] Make AI stop losing to the game‚Äôs AI  
- [ ] Pretend this was the plan all along  

---

### **Shoutouts**  
- **DeepSeek-R1**: Wrote this README and fixed OP‚Äôs code.  
- **Apple Silicon**: For not melting during 3-hour training sessions.  
- **OpenAI**: For making ChatGPT apologize when OP asked how to bypass `gymnasium` errors.

### **License**  
MIT License ‚Äì Do whatever. If you make money, buy OP some coffee.
